 * JavaScript Arrays Basics
Introduction
Arrays are one of the most fundamental data structures in JavaScript. They allow you to store multiple values in a single variable, which makes organizing and managing related data much easier. Whether you're building a simple to-do list or a complex web application, understanding arrays is essential for effective JavaScript programming.

In this lesson, we'll explore the basics of JavaScript arrays, including how to create them, access their elements, modify them, and perform common operations.

What is an Array?
An array in JavaScript is an ordered collection of values. These values can be of any type, including numbers, strings, objects, or even other arrays. Think of an array as a list of items stored in a specific order.
