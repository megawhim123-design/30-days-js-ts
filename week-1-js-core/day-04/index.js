 * Notes:
 * What Are Functions?
A function is a reusable block of code designed to perform a particular task. Think of functions as "mini-programs" within your main program. Instead of writing the same code multiple times, you can create a function once and call it whenever needed.

Function Declaration
There are several ways to declare functions in JavaScript. The most common method is called function declaration:

function greet() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}

This creates a function named greet that, when called, will print "Hello, world!" to the console.

Calling (Invoking) Functions
Declaring a function only defines it - the code inside doesn't run until you call (or invoke) the function:

// Function declaration
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}

// Function call/invocation
greet(); // Output: Hello, world!

You can call a function as many times as you need:

greet(); // Output: Hello, world!
greet(); // Output: Hello, world!
greet(); // Output: Hello, world!
